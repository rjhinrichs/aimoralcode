# The NRBC Ethical Value Layers

This section introduces the **Normative**, **Regulatory**, **Behavioral**, and **Conceptual** value structures that form the backbone of the AI Moral Code. Each image below represents one core component of the NRBC architecture.

---

## Normative Values  
These define ethical commitments drawn from belief systems, ideals, and universal moral reasoning.

## Behavioral Values  
These illustrate the ethical expectations for AI interaction across social norms, customs, and dispositions.

## Conceptual Values  
These enable iterative ethical development, model moral prototypes, and govern ethical MLOps over time.
