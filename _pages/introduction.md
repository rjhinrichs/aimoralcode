  <h1>Why an AI Moral Code?</h1>
  <p>
    As artificial intelligence transitions from narrow tools to autonomous systems,
    it becomes clear that technical performance alone is not enough. AI must not only make decisions‚Äîit must make moral ones.
  </p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Existing ethical frameworks are fragmented across disciplines. Developers lack operational tools.
    Regulators lag behind innovation. Philosophers warn of existential risks, while users face algorithmic opacity.
    We need a unifying moral architecture‚Äîone that is rigorous, adaptive, and machine-readable.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Solution: NRBC Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The AI Moral Code offers a multi-layered framework rooted in four ethical domains:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Normative:</strong> moral imperatives, duties, and universal values</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory:</strong> law, compliance, governance mechanisms</li>
    <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> expected norms in social and cultural contexts</li>
    <li><strong>Conceptual:</strong> adaptive logic for AI development and iteration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Together, these layers support ethical alignment across design, deployment, and system evolution.

  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <p>
    The AI Moral Code serves developers, ethicists, researchers, policy architects, and educators.
    It is especially relevant for those working in autonomous systems, AGI alignment, cybersecurity, and applied AI governance.
