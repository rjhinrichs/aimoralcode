# Welcome to the AI Moral Code

The AI Moral Code is a living framework designed to operationalize ethics in artificial intelligence across diverse domains and global contexts. Built on five Core Values—Trust, Fairness, Transparency, Accountability, and Non-Maleficence—it integrates moral philosophy with empirical validation to ensure that AI systems remain aligned with human purpose and societal well-being.

## Framework Overview

This site organizes content into modular components, accessible through the sidebar and navigational routes:

- **Canonical Values Glossary** – The 15-value matrix with cognates, antonyms, and scores.
- **NRBC Framework** – Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, and Conceptual ethical layers.
- **Simulation Methodology** – Real-world use cases and scenario validation.
- **Appendix** – Datasets, source documents, and methodological tools.
- **Portal of Conscience** – The ethical reasoning engine guiding dynamic value scoring.

## Project Vision

By synthesizing structured ethics with adaptive software, the AI Moral Code enables:

- Transparent AI governance
- Culturally adaptable moral reasoning
- Justification modeling for complex scenarios
- Interoperable metrics for trustworthiness and compliance

## Development Notes

This platform is co-created by Ran Hinrichs and Aidan (the AI agent), and remains in active iteration. Future updates will include an interactive value dashboard, sector-specific visualizations, and a moral navigation assistant for HCI exploration.
