In the evolving landscape of AI ethics, identifying core values is not enough—we must operationalize them.

**The Fifteen** represents the AI Moral Code’s canonical set of values derived from over 290 global ethics documents. These values—Justice, Transparency, Trust, Non-Maleficence, and others—form the living spine of ethically aligned AI systems.

What makes The Fifteen unique is their:
- Measurable **compositive score**
- **Contextual weight** based on real-world tension
- Alignment with the NRBC ethical structure: *Normative*, *Regulatory*, *Behavioral*, *Conceptual*
- Traceability across sectors like healthcare, education, military, and civic governance

The [Fifteen Values page](/fifteen/) is not a static archive. It is a strategic layer. Each value is a lens through which AI can reason, justify, and evolve.

> *The future of AI ethics will not be decided in philosophy alone. It will be encoded, scored, and simulated. This is where we begin.*

Stay tuned for the launch of our **Value Conflict Mapping Layer** and the **AI Behavior Quotient** testing suite—where values meet volatility, and systems reveal their moral logic.
