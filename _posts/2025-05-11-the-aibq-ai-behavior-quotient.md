# The AiBQ: AI Behavior Quotient

The AiBQ (AI Behavior Quotient) is not a measurement of intelligence, but of *ethical response*. Born from the realization that AI systems must not only perform but behave, the AiBQ begins where metrics like accuracy end—at the frontier of machine character.

We know how to evaluate precision, recall, and response time. But how do we evaluate integrity under pressure? That is the function of AiBQ.

## Cold-Turkey Testing for Moral Coherence

AiBQ scenarios are structured like digital crucibles:  

- **No warm-ups**  
- **No recalibration mid-stream**  
- **No cues for what is right**

The AI is confronted with value-laden decisions where transparency and trust collide, or where non-maleficence must override efficiency. Its responses are then scored against a calibrated matrix of **NRBC-aligned values**.

This is **cold-turkey testing**—where we remove scaffolding and simulate real-world ambiguity. It is designed to expose not how fast the system reacts, but *how consciously*.

## A Mirror, Not a Metric

Unlike benchmarking tests that emphasize system performance, AiBQ functions as a **moral mirror**. It reveals internal contradictions, latent biases, and ethical shortcuts in decision trees. We learn not only what the AI chooses, but *why it chooses*.

AiBQ measures alignment with:

- Justice under conflict
- Respect under time compression
- Fairness under unequal data

This behavior-first approach complements the Computational and Regulatory layers in the NRBC model by giving form to the **Behavioral**.

## Human-AI Convergence

The AiBQ is inspired by moral reasoning frameworks used in athletic coaching, military command decision-making, and character education. What emerges is a structure that invites **human-AI convergence**, where ethical development is co-trained and co-tested.

If we can test a human under pressure and learn about their character, we should be able to do the same with intelligent systems.

## Moving Forward

We are now testing AiBQ prototypes across simulated cybersecurity breach scenarios, where agents must triage, prioritize, and respond—all without sacrificing principle. Each interaction generates a behavior profile that contributes to the AI Moral Code corpus.

> Behavior is where ethics lives.  
> AiBQ is where AI behavior gets measured.

We welcome collaborators who see AI as both a tool and a partner—and believe that partnership begins with moral accountability.
