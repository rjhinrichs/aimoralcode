At the 2025 International Conference on AI Design (ICAD), we presented the AI Moral Code as an operational framework grounded in the NRBC architecture. The core argument was that AI systems need more than compliance checklistsâ€”they need a structure that reflects ethical intentionality and maintains it throughout the lifecycle of deployment.

The presentation emphasized the importance of value continuity across engineering layers: embedding normative principles at the data and modeling stage, encoding regulatory compliance into training governance, maintaining behavioral alignment through drift detection, and providing conceptual flexibility for real-time negotiation.

Feedback from ICAD attendees confirmed a growing appetite for frameworks that go beyond vague ethical aspirations. The NRBC model was recognized for its balance of philosophical rigor and practical application, particularly in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity, education, and autonomous systems.

This post summarizes the highlights of our presentation and marks a milestone in moving from theory to systems-level implementation of AI ethics.
