# AI Moral Code

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/rjhinrichs/aimoralcode)](https://github.com/rjhinrichs/aimoralcode/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

A research-driven framework for embedding ethical architecture into AI systems. This project presents the NRBC model—**Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, and Conceptual**—to operationalize core values such as:

- Trust  
- Fairness  
- Transparency  
- Accountability  
- Non-maleficence  

Developed from an empirical analysis of 291 global AI ethics documents (2006–2025), the AI Moral Code offers a layered governance architecture ready for application in education, justice, healthcare, and autonomous systems.
