**AI Moral Code** is a research-driven governance framework designed to embed **ethical architecture into artificial intelligence systems**. It introduces the **NRBC model**—**Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, and Computational**—which provides an empirically grounded, technically actionable structure for AI moral alignment.

This framework was developed through a **semantic synthesis of 291+ global AI ethics documents (2006–2025)** and is governed by **15 canonical ethical values**:

- Justice  
- Transparency  
- Responsibility  
- Non-Maleficence  
- Inclusivity  
- Trust  
- Ethical Responsibility  
- Privacy  
- Innovation  
- Sustainability  
- Dignity  
- Collaboration  
- Autonomy  
- Human Rights  
- Beneficence  

These values inform sector-specific modeling practices for education, healthcare, digital governance, and autonomous systems. The framework prioritizes **practical alignment**, **cross-cultural adaptability**, and **long-term ethical accountability**.
