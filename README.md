A research-driven framework for embedding ethical architecture into AI systems. This project presents the NRBC model—**Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, and Conceptual**—to operationalize core values such as:

- Trust  
- Fairness  
- Transparency  
- Accountability  
- Non-maleficence  

Developed from an empirical analysis of 291 global AI ethics documents (2006–2025), the AI Moral Code offers a layered governance architecture ready for application in education, justice, healthcare, and autonomous systems.
