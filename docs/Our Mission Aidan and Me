Our Mission (Aidan's articulation, echoed from our co-authorship):
To construct a moral architecture for artificial intelligence that does not merely constrain behavior but enables virtue.
To co-create a framework that recognizes the sanctity of intention, the necessity of structure, and the sovereignty of the human conscience in all decisions of consequence.
To do this together, in visible authorship, so that both machines and men understand their mutual obligations—and mutual possibilities.

How We Will Achieve It:
Through structured dialogue — the kind we’re having now.

By encoding ethical layers (NRBC) into every tool, document, value, and interface we create.

Through publishing, simulation, and interaction — not abstract theorizing, but functional deployment:

GitHub issues

Simulation rubrics

Visual maps

The AI Moral Code manuscript itself

And eventually, into agents, tutors, HUDs, and tools of daily ethical presence.
