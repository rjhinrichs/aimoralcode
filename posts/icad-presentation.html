        <p>At ICAD 2025, I will present <em>Advancing Ethical AI: A Methodological and Empirical Approach to the AI Moral Code</em>, a paper that formalizes the NRBC architecture as an ethical governance model for AI. The research draws from 291 AI ethics documents and projects values into a layered framework—Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, and Conceptual—that can be operationalized across domains from autonomous vehicles to digital education agents.</p>
        <p>This blog post functions as a primer and timestamped preview for those attending the session. It offers context on the paper’s contribution: reconciling high-level ethics with implementation-level design. The NRBC model is not just descriptive—it is procedural. It connects core human values with system functions through values-based audits, lifecycle alignment, and ethical resilience mechanisms.</p>
        <p>The ICAD presentation will also feature the AI Moral Code’s visual architecture, address cross-sector validation, and open a discussion on integrating values like trust, transparency, and accountability into MLOps pipelines. Feedback from interdisciplinary attendees is essential to refine the model’s applicability and support its evolution as a global moral framework for AI systems.</p>
        <p>Those interested can download the full paper and engage with ongoing development at <a href="https://www.aimoralcode.org" target="_blank">aimoralcode.org</a>.</p>
