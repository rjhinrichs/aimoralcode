        <p>As AI systems scale globally, they increasingly encounter culturally diverse expectations of fairness, respect, responsibility, and authority. What one culture views as transparency, another may perceive as overexposure; what one treats as autonomy, another may construe as disrespect. In these contexts, AI must do more than comply—it must negotiate.</p>
        <p>The AI Moral Code anticipates this reality through the inclusion of Cultural and Social Values under the NRBC framework. These layers allow AI agents to modulate their behavior based on the governance traditions, relational norms, and moral grammars of the society they operate within. The role of AI shifts from enforcer to facilitator, from classifier to conciliator.</p>
        <p>Future agents will need the capacity to harmonize conflicting moral signals across contexts—what we call moral polyphony. This demands a level of contextual sensitivity and ethical pluralism often absent in current LLMs and policy engines. Design patterns for moral negotiation will require both embedded values and a dynamic reasoning engine capable of adapting to social feedback and moral discourse in real time.</p>
        <p>AI will not unify humanity through dominance, but through deliberation. Its greatest utility may be in modeling the moral middle—holding cultural tensions in dialogue long enough for humans to choose wisely.</p>
