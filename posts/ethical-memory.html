        <p>Social values do not merely express cultural preferences—they function as ethical memory. In a society, they synchronize group behavior and reinforce accountability through norms, rituals, and expectations. In AI systems, social values can offer temporal coherence: they help the agent ‘remember’ what a community considers good, harmful, or worthy of protection—even when the system is not directly policed.</p>
        <p>The AI Moral Code integrates this into the NRBC model under the governance layer, where behavioral and cultural values provide ethical scaffolding. These values serve not only as moral signals but as calibration tools—realigning AI behavior with community intent after drift or misalignment events. This is especially relevant in decentralized or adaptive environments, such as AI in healthcare diagnostics or education feedback loops.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, embedding social values into AI is not about instilling local bias, but preserving continuity with a society’s moral trajectory. Ethical memory, like institutional memory, prevents regression. Social values are the archival layer of AI ethics.</p>
