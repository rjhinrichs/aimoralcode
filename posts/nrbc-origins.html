        <p>The Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, and Conceptual (NRBC) architecture emerged from a structured review of 291 AI ethics documents published between 2006 and 2025. This architecture was not imposed but discovered—surfaced through semantic frequency analysis and conceptual clustering. NRBC provides the scaffolding for ethical AI governance and design, uniting principles (normative), policy (regulatory), customs (behavioral), and system logic (conceptual) under one taxonomy.</p>
        <p>Its foundation draws inspiration from classical moral reasoning (Kant, Aquinas), governance theory (Ostrom), and AI ethics pioneers such as Stuart Russell, Yoshua Bengio, and Timnit Gebru. The model’s layered function offers a modular yet integrated path forward for human-compatible AI—especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare, justice, and education.</p>
        <p>By sharing it here, I formally timestamp its release as intellectual property, and begin Phase 2 of the AI Moral Code’s public engagement.</p>
