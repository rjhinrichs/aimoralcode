        <p>Transparency is often framed as a value or a policy outcome, but in system architecture it functions best as a design pattern. It shapes how decisions are logged, how users interrogate system reasoning, and how ethical accountability is made computationally visible. In the AI Moral Code framework, transparency is not bolted on—it is woven in.</p>
        <p>Drawing from software engineering and human-centered design, transparency manifests in interface explainability, audit trail retention, and runtime model introspection. These features allow not only oversight but trust—what Bengio calls “cognitively aligned transparency.” It is the difference between having a manual and having a co-pilot who speaks your language.</p>
        <p>Without transparency, fairness claims are unverifiable, and redress mechanisms collapse. But when treated as a design pattern, transparency links directly to moral legibility and collective governance. It makes AI systems inspectable, contestable, and ultimately more human-compatible.</p>
