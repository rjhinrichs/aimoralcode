Transparency is often treated as a compliance requirement or post-hoc documentation task. But in ethical AI system design, it functions more effectively as a foundational design patternâ€”built in from the start rather than added later.

By treating transparency as a structural property, engineers can expose how decisions are made, what data is influencing them, and what constraints are shaping outputs. This includes interface-level clarity for users, audit trails for regulators, and explanation modules for internal governance.

Within the NRBC architecture, transparency interacts with all layers. It expresses normative values like fairness and honesty, serves regulatory obligations for inspection, reinforces behavioral alignment through feedback, and reflects conceptual clarity about model intent.

Designing for transparency early can prevent ethical opacity later. It invites scrutiny, builds trust, and strengthens the legitimacy of autonomous systems acting in complex environments.
