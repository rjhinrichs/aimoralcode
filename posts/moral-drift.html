        <p>Once deployed, AI systems are not static. They interact with environments, absorb new data distributions, and adapt under pressure from users, market incentives, or adversarial actors. This opens the door to <em>moral drift</em>: the erosion or mutation of ethical boundaries over time.</p>
        <p>Examples include content moderation systems that grow either overcautious or too permissive; recommendation engines that incentivize polarization; or surveillance systems that exceed originally approved use cases. These drifts are rarely engineered—they are emergent. But the responsibility for them is not diminished by their indirectness.</p>
        <p>The NRBC framework anticipates this: Behavioral values need continuous calibration; Regulatory constraints require auditability; Conceptual systems must include feedback gates; and Normative principles must be retrained into the agent’s ethical core. Ethics is not a training phase—it is a lifecycle discipline.</p>
        <p>Embedding humility-by-design and simulation-based testing for edge cases are among the architectural measures proposed in the AI Moral Code to proactively guard against decay.</p>
