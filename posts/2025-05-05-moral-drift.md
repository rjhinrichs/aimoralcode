Deployed AI systems face ethical erosion over time, a process known as "moral drift." As training data becomes stale, objectives shift, or system constraints evolve, AI behavior can deviate from its original value alignment. This post explores key mechanisms of drift, including silent parameter creep and goal misgeneralization.

We also explore how incorporating feedback loops and value retraining within NRBCâ€™s behavioral and regulatory layers can mitigate drift and restore system trust.
