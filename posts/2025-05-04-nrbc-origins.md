The NRBC model—Normative, Regulatory, Behavioral, Conceptual—was born out of a need to harmonize fragmented AI ethics principles into a coherent framework. Early research in 2022 highlighted the limitations of checklist-based compliance. As more nations developed AI governance plans, it became clear that values like trust and fairness needed a layered architecture that could be adapted, validated, and enforced.

This blog post traces the philosophical roots and empirical validation of NRBC as a tool for integrating ethical theory with engineering practice. It represents a fusion of classical moral reasoning and real-world implementation demands.
